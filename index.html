    <p>Wow.  What a week, I learned so much.  I began with only a tertiary understanding of html and css, and have expanded that considerably.  The pre-course introduced me to bootstrap and css, so I knew a little of what they were, but not what there full capabilities are.  Still learning, I am sure.  But as far as mockup and layout, my world has grown.  I see how hover affects and pseudo classes are addesd as well as proper context and applying style.  My previous attemts were manipulated within html.  Now I see the merit, and have the know-how to utilize css.  And I love bootstrap, with its esy to use 12 column system.  Like I said, learning so much.  Just through continual use, I see how much more there is to learn, and how much more proficient I have already become.<br>Additionally, I learned about github repositories and how to make my working projects live on the internet.  This includes utilizing an http-server and publishing to a github page for viewing.  Lots of ways to see how my progress is coming.  Great first week!

    <p> Week 2:
        Learned a lot again.  I had a very small understanding of java script, mostly int he form of loops.  But this week helped me solidify the difference between if and for and while loops, and get the proper syntax down.  I learned about objects, but am still having trouble deciding when to use them, versus the arrays.  I can work it out, but slowly.  Certainly more practice helps make them more robust in my understanding.  Lets see...<br> I also learned anout on click methods.  That is cool, making actions happen on the page.  I am having trouble with buttons right now, but I think its because I am tired.  Also, I need to work on figuring out what other people's code is trying to do.  <br> Most exciting of all, I learned about debugging.  holy amazing did that help trouble shoot.  I typed a lot of code without testing, initially, and without the debugger I would have been lost as to where to start fixing it.  Still a long path, but at least it worked out in the end.
    </p>
    <p> Okay, week 3 is in the books.  learned a lot about data and working with data.  about separating the functions apart into a service and controller.  about children and parents.  about data structuring and DOM manipulation. <br> Through simple use, I see my css work improving as i become more familiar with the ins and outs <br> we just began to touch on j qwery, which I unsterstand, but do not have a robust ability to apply it myself.  it is not formed completely in the head yet.  I am finding this with the more complex concepts, (syntax in of itself being difficult), but I can start to widdle things down effectively once the ball starts rolling.  before that, things can feel a little overwhelming to start.  anyway,  learning lots, but still lots to  improve upon. </p>

    <p> week4:</p>
    <p> Week 4 seemed like a big week.  lots of learning and hard work.  learned a bit more about callbacks, but still need to see them in more places to get a better appreciation for their abilities.  Learned about structuring the app better for protection- with a controller and a service.  Very helpful. keeps your data protected from other workers and from yourself.  mostly, I learned a lot in the hackathon.  lerned how to partition workloads, how to communicate with your goals and ideas, and learned how to read and trouble shoot another teammates work.  Also, sometimes you just have to walk a way and come back a little later.  The trouble shooting aspect is really imporvinig for me, but i tend to work more slowly while tired.  and new ideas seem impossible.  I think that might be it.  late addition to my week 4 update.  sprry!</p>
