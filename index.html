    <p>Wow.  What a week, I learned so much.  I began with only a tertiary understanding of html and css, and have expanded that considerably.  The pre-course introduced me to bootstrap and css, so I knew a little of what they were, but not what there full capabilities are.  Still learning, I am sure.  But as far as mockup and layout, my world has grown.  I see how hover affects and pseudo classes are addesd as well as proper context and applying style.  My previous attemts were manipulated within html.  Now I see the merit, and have the know-how to utilize css.  And I love bootstrap, with its esy to use 12 column system.  Like I said, learning so much.  Just through continual use, I see how much more there is to learn, and how much more proficient I have already become.<br>Additionally, I learned about github repositories and how to make my working projects live on the internet.  This includes utilizing an http-server and publishing to a github page for viewing.  Lots of ways to see how my progress is coming.  Great first week!

    <p> Week 2:
        Learned a lot again.  I had a very small understanding of java script, mostly int he form of loops.  But this week helped me solidify the difference between if and for and while loops, and get the proper syntax down.  I learned about objects, but am still having trouble deciding when to use them, versus the arrays.  I can work it out, but slowly.  Certainly more practice helps make them more robust in my understanding.  Lets see...<br> I also learned anout on click methods.  That is cool, making actions happen on the page.  I am having trouble with buttons right now, but I think its because I am tired.  Also, I need to work on figuring out what other people's code is trying to do.  <br> Most exciting of all, I learned about debugging.  holy amazing did that help trouble shoot.  I typed a lot of code without testing, initially, and without the debugger I would have been lost as to where to start fixing it.  Still a long path, but at least it worked out in the end.
