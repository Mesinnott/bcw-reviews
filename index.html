    <p>Wow.  What a week, I learned so much.  I began with only a tertiary understanding of html and css, and have expanded that considerably.  The pre-course introduced me to bootstrap and css, so I knew a little of what they were, but not what there full capabilities are.  Still learning, I am sure.  But as far as mockup and layout, my world has grown.  I see how hover affects and pseudo classes are addesd as well as proper context and applying style.  My previous attemts were manipulated within html.  Now I see the merit, and have the know-how to utilize css.  And I love bootstrap, with its esy to use 12 column system.  Like I said, learning so much.  Just through continual use, I see how much more there is to learn, and how much more proficient I have already become.<br>Additionally, I learned about github repositories and how to make my working projects live on the internet.  This includes utilizing an http-server and publishing to a github page for viewing.  Lots of ways to see how my progress is coming.  Great first week!
